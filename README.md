# Overview

I wrote a basic platformer where you use the arrow keys to jump around the map from platform to platform. 

I started out trying to do this from scratch, but I found that I needed assistance and ended up using a youtube tutorial to help my understand how unity worked. After using the tutorial, I had some bugs, but I was able to fix them without to much trouble.

# Development Environment

I used unity to create my game and I used visual studio code to write my c# script for the game. C# is by default the language used in unity, and I used unity because it was the main game creation softwares I had heard of previously.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Item 1: I currently am having trouble uploading the project files to github due to the metadata. 
* Item 2: Take the engine I have and make actual levels
* Item 3: Do more debuging to avoid things like the camera changing angles and the player falling forever without respawn.
* Item 4: Make more games because it's fun.
